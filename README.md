In this project, a real-world problem was chosen to apply the conceptual database design theories introduced in EE467 DATABASES course. However, the designing and implementation phase follows the conceptional design techniques, first to declare entities, attributes, and domain. After that, the relationships and ratios were highlighted in the EER model. The business rules will be applied on the database application chosen and discussed, then the database will be implemented in MySQL and the tables will be filled using an online collected database. Furthermore, a front-end designing will be implemented using HTML, CSS, Java Script to build an online page forms and access to the database using XAMPP. This report contains all the details regarding the work done on the database application, the chosen application will be explained, then the EER data model will be illustrated, followed by the back-end programming to implement the database design, and finally, the front-end designing will be shown.
